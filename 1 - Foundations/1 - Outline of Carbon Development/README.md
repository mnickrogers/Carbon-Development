# Carbon Development Outline
## Goals
I intend the Carbon Development process to create efficient organization for teams of people building software projects. Carbon Development is inspired by an idea I think of as [Problem-Driven Development](../Problem-Driven Development), which fundamentally views the progress of teams by the types of problems that they solve.

Carbon Development focuses on breaking projects into tasks then accomplishing those tasks. Thus, the framework emphasizes the importance of problem-solving around specific tasks. In sum, Carbon Development views every project as a collection of tasks in need of completion and a set of problems associated with each task. **Tasks are the foundation of Carbon Development; everything else is built around them.**

## Components

### Task-Based Containers
Teams act like self-contained units that are grouped by their relative abilities to solve a specific task (see [Employee Management](../Employee Management) for a description of this abilities rating system).

### Team-based problem-solving
Individuals should leverage the expertise from teammates who are grouped with specific strengths.

### Individual production
The development process should rely heavily on an individualistic ethic that inspires hard work and demands focused and self-driven discipline. In this way, Carbon Development aims to create efficiency and perfectionism from the ground-up.
