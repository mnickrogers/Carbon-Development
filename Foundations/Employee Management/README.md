# Employee Management
## Overview

Managers should maintain a list of relative skills associated with each task member. The metric for representing these skills could be quantified by a number, for example. More likely, however, these skills may not be qualifiable like this. Instead, qualatative measurements may be necessary. Ultimately, this metric for measurement should not matter so long as it is consistent among members of teams and relative to each member in those teams.
