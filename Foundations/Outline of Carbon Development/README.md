# Carbon Development Outline
## Goals
I intend the Carbon Development process to create efficient organization for teams of people building software projects. Carbon Development is inspired by an idea I think of as [Problem-Driven Development](../Problem-Driven Development), which fundamentally views the progress of teams by the types of problems that they solve.

## Components

### Task-Based Containers
Teams act like self-contained units that are grouped by their relative abilities to solve a specific task (see [Employee Management](../Employee Management) for a description of this abilities rating system).

### Team-based problem-solving
Individuals should leverage the expertise from teammates who are grouped with specific strengths.

### Individual production
The development process should rely heavily on an individualistic ethic that inspires hard work and demands focused and self-driven discipline. In this way, Carbon Development aims to create efficiency and perfectionism from the ground-up.
