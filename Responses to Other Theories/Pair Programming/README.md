##Paired Programming

We should, I believe, reject paired programming as a general practice within organizations.

Pair programming describes the process of requiring two programmers work at a single workstation on a single project at once. As one programmer, usually referred to as the *driver*, writes code, the other, usually called the *observer* or the *navigator* looks on.

##Idle Time

We should view the idle time of programmers as a loss to problem-solving time. Since efficient teams should push the limits of current technologies, inventing new ones as necessary, we should view programming as a cycle of problem-solving, pushing the limits of that solution, then creating better solutions. Those solutions then make new technologies and processes available that did not previously exist, which in turn means new capabilities that did not previously exist. These new capabilities inspire new possibilities, which in turn present new problems for teams to solve. This process fundamentally drives development in the world of computer science. Iâ€™ll call this paradigm *problem-driven development*. 

Problem-driven development has a lot in common with the idea of test-driven development (TDD). In TDD, developers design tests and develop until programs pass those tests. After a program passes a test, developers work on implementing new features by creating new tests for those features to pass. In problem-driven development, developers work until they solve a problem, then go about pushing their technology until new problems arise.

While test-driven development describes a process by which people can create software, problem-driven development describes a process by which teams can plan to create software.

Programmers can work quickly on mundane tasks. Good programmers, for the most part, avoid having to perform mundane tasks at all. However, some tasks are not *mundane*, but require little problem-solving skills
